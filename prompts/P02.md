## Program of the Day #2

In POTD #1, you wrote a multiplication quiz and you chose the question. Now, let's make a new version of the math quiz program where the user gets to specify the numbers. The program should take two **command line arguments**, representing the first and second integers to be multiplied. The user then has a chance to enter their answer, before you print out the correct answer. A sample run of the program might look like the following:

```
>>> %Run P02_quiz2.py 10 4
What is 10 * 4 ?
40
10 * 4 is 40
```
An example run where the user didn't type any answer when asked for input (but just hit enter) would look like this:
```
>>> %Run P02_quiz2.py 30 2
What is 30 * 2 ?

30 * 2 is 60
```


*Note:* When showing example runs of programs that take program arguments, the first line of the transcript shows what's displayed as a result of pressing Thonny's Friendly Green Run Button with the given arguments in the Program Arguments box. In the above example, the contents of the Program arguments box is `10 4`.

## Other Practice Problems

1. Suppose that you are writing a program and you have two variables `x` and `y` that contain values. You'd like to **swap** the values stored in those variables, so what was previously stored in `x` is now stored in `y` and what was stored in `y` is now in `x`. For example if the following program is completed with your code, it should output `4 10`. *Note:* your solution should not depend on the specific values (e.g., 4 and 10) - it should work regardless of what `x` and `y` are set to.

   ```python
   x = 10
   y = 4
   # your code here
   print(x, y)
   ```
