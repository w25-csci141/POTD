## Program of the Day #4

Write a program to extract the $10^k s digit from a number $n$, given $k$ and $n$. Assume $k$ and $n$ are both positive integers, and $n$ has at least $k+1$ digits. For example, to extract the 100's digit from 1531 we'd run our program with $n=1531$ and  $k=2$ (because $10^2$ is 100). *Hint:* try using modulus and integer divison together - for example, notice that the 100's digit of 3624 can be calculated as `3624 // 100 % 10`. A couple example runs are given below:

```
>>> %Run P04_extract_digit.py 1531 2
The 100s digit of 1531 is 5
>>> %Run P04_extract_digit.py 13 0
The 1s digit of 13 is 3
```



## Other Practice Problems

1. Write a program that prints the table of powers of two as in the example below. Use one `print` call per line and use the `sep` keyword argument.

   ```
   2^0:   1
   2^1:   2
   2^2:   4
   2^3:   8
   2^4:  16
   2^5:  32
   2^6:  64
   2^7: 128
   ```

3. Suppose a variable `p` contains a positive integer. Write a Python *expression* that evaluates to a string containing the binary representation of $2^p - 1$ with no leading zeros. For example: if p = 3, you'd give the binary for $2^3 - 1 = 7$, which comes out to `111`. *Hint:* work out a couple more examples with different values of $p$ and see if you can find a pattern.

4. Typically, integers are stored on computers by default using 64 bits. What's the largest integer that can be represented using 64 bits? I recommend using a calculator (or Python!) for this one.

5. (*) Integers can be negative, but computer memory can't store "+" and "-" signs, only 0s and 1s. For this reason, the decimal-to-binary integer conversion approach I presented doesn't have any way to represent negative integers. Can you come up with an approach to represent both negative and positive integers using binary?
