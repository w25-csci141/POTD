## Program of the Day #5

In the lecture video, you saw truth tables for the `and` and `or` operators. Another boolean operator that doesn't have a special keyword in Python is called "exclusive or", or "XOR" for short. This operator evaluates to `True` if exactly one of its operands is `True`, and evaluates to `False` if its operands are both `True` or both `False`. Fill in the truth table for the XOR operator:

    | `a xor b`          | `b` is `True` | `b` is `False` |
    | ------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
    | **`a` is `True`**  |               |                |
    | **`a` is `False`** |               |                |

Now, write a program that takes two arguments, which you should assume are either `T` or `F`, representing the boolean values `True` and `False`. Your program should compute the `xor` operator on the inputs and print `True` or `False` accordingly. Example run:
```
>>> %Run P05_xor.py F T
True
>>>
```



## Other Practice Problems

1. Suppose your program contains variables `a` and `b` that have boolean values. Which of the following evaluate to `a XOR b`, according to the definition of XOR in the Program of the Day prompt above? 

   1. `not (a and b) and not(not a and not b)`
   2. `a or b`
   3. `a and b or not (a or b)`
   4. `(a or b) and not (a and b)`
   5. `a or b and not a and b`

2. Way back in Lecture 1, recall that we started writing a math quiz program:

   > Write a **math quiz program** that works as follows: it begins by printing an arithmetic problem of your choosing. Then, it prompts the user to enter an answer. Finally, once they have pressed enter, the program prints a message showing the correct answer.

   With boolean comparison operators, we're one step closer to being able to check the user's answer. Write the math quiz program so that it prints `True` if the user's answer is correct and `False` if the user's answer is not correct. A couple sample runs of the program are given below:

   ```
   What is 4 * 6? 24
   Your answer is True!
   ```

   ```
   What is 4 * 6? 2
   Your answer is False!
   ```
