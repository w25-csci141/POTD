## Program of the Day #6

The time of day can be written using clock time with an "AM" or "PM", or it can be written using 24-hour time (sometimes called "military time"). In 24-hour time, minutes are written the same, but the hour of the day ranges from 0 to 23, so you don't have to specify AM or PM. Hours from 1 to 12 are written the same but with zero padding to make it two digits - 1:00 AM is 01:00, 10:00 AM is 10:00. Hours after noon continue counting from 12 instead of going back to 1, so 1:00 PM is written 13:00, and 8PM is written 20:00. Midnight is written 0:00, and 11:59PM is written 23:59. Write a program that takes three command line arguments: an hour, minute, and AM or PM, then prints the given time in 24-hour format. Allow the minute arguments to be either one or two digits.

```
>>> %Run P06_time_convert.py 2 00 AM
02:00
>>> 
```

```
>>> %Run P06_time_convert.py 10 35 PM
22:35
>>>
```

```
>>> %Run P06_time_convert.py 9 3 AM
09:03
>>>
```

```
>>> %Run P06_time_convert.py 10 03 AM
10:03
>>>
```


## Other Practice Problems

1. We made it! We finally know how to give the user of our math quiz program the customized feedback they deserve. Modify (or rewrite) your program from E05 Problem 1 to behave as follows:

   ```
   What is 4 * 6? 24
   Your answer is correct!
   ```
   
   ```
   What is 4 * 6? 18
   Incorrect - better luck next time.
   ```

3. Write a program that prompts a user for the start and end time of an event and tells them whether the event conflicts with the CSCI 141 class time (just lecture, not lab). To make things simpler for ourselves, let's consider hours only and assume the user enters the hour in 24-hour time. You can also assume that no event starts before midnight and ends after midnight.

   Here are two sample outputs for a program written for a class that runs from 11am to 12pm. The output might be different given your actual lecture time.

   ```
   What day is the event? Monday
   What time does the event start? 8
   What time does the event end? 10
   That doesn't conflict with your 141 lecture. Have fun!
   ```

   ```
   What day is the event? Wednesday
   What time does the event start? 10
   What time does the event end? 12
   That event conflicts with your 141 lecture. Too bad you can't go!
   ```

4. Recall the `xor` ("exclusive or") operator from last time: `a` XOR `b` is true if exactly one of `a` and `b` is true, and false otherwise. Without using the `and`, `or`, and `not` operators, write a program that prompts a user for boolean values`a` and `b` and prints the value of `a` XOR `b`. *Hint 1:* The `bool` type conversion function will convert an integer to a boolean; 0 is converted to False, and 1 is converted to True. *Hint 2:* You'll probably need nested conditionals!

   ```
   Enter a (0 for False, 1 for True): 1
   Enter b (0 for false, 1 for True): 0
   a XOR b is True
   ```

   ```
   Enter a (0 for False, 1 for True): 1
   Enter b (0 for false, 1 for True): 1
   a XOR b is False
   ```
