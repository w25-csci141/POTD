## Program of the Day #10

In this problem, you will implement five simple functions that we'll use to help us process times (or durations). The first three functions will help us convert a raw duration given in seconds to a number of hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, 7326 seconds corresponds to 2 hours, 2 minutes and 6 seconds. This is because each hour is 3600 seconds, so 2 hours accounts for 7200 seconds; the remaining 126 seconds constitutes 2 minutes (at 60 seconds each) and 6 seconds. Today's program will take a single command line argument giving a number of seconds as a command line argument, then print the number of hours, minutes, and seconds in hh:mm:ss format. 

To do this, you'll implement five functions that break down this slightly complicated task into smaller, less complex pieces:

* `get_hours(seconds)` returns the number of whole hours in a given number of seconds.
* `get_minutes(seconds)` returns the number of whole minutes in the given number of seconds. The number of minutes does not count those accounted for by hours, meaning, for example, that `get_minutes(7326)` returns 2, not 122.
* `get_seconds(seconds)` returns the number of seconds left over after hours and minutes are accounted for.
* `padprint(number)` prints out the given number, but inserts a zero before one-digit numbers so that the printed number has at least two digits.
* `print_hms(seconds)` prints the duration represented by the given number of seconds in hh:mm:ss format. For example, `print_hms(7326)` prints `02:02:06`.

Finally, implement the main program behavior described above inside the given skeleton file.

Pay particular attention to the difference between *returning* and *printing*. The first three functions **return** their results, while the last two **print** some output and do not return anything. A run of the main program (which has been written for you, but relies on the functions you'll implement) looks like this:

```
>>> %Run P10_hms.py 7425
02:03:45
```

## Other Practice Problems

1. Write a function `parrot` that takes one string argument (`s`) and one integer argument (`n`) and prints that string `n` times with a space in between; at the end, the function should print a single newline. Examples:

   ```
   >>> parrot("hello!", 3)
   hello! hello! hello!
   >>> parrot("click", 5)
   click click click click click
   >>>
   ```
   
2. Write a function `rectangle_area` that takes two numbers `height` and `width` and **returns** the area of a `height`-by-`width` rectangle. Recall that a $h \times w$ rectangle has area $h*w$.

3. Write a function `circle_area` that takes one number `radius` and **returns** the area of a circle with that radius. Recall that a circle with radius $r$ has area $\pi r^2$.

4. Write a function `get_float` that takes a string, prints that string, then prompts a user for a floating-point number and returns their input converted to a float.

   ```
   >>> get_float("Enter a radius: ")
    Enter a radius: 4
   4.0
   ```

   (Note: in the above, `4` is entered by the user, and `4.0` is printed on the Thonny shell in dark blue, showing the return value of the call to `get_float`)

5. Use the functions from the prior three problems to create a geometry game as follows. The program takes two command line arguments specifying the width and height of a rectangle. Then, it repeatedly prompts the user for a radius. For each radius provided, print a message saying whether the circle with the given radius has area greater than, smaller than, or equal to the rectangle's. If the user enters a negative number, the program should terminate.

6. Write a function `print_banner` that takes a string argument and prints that string, surrounded by a rectangle of `#` symbols. Here are some examples of how the function might be called:

   ```
   >>> print_banner("Hello!")
   ########
   #Hello!#
   ########
   >>> print_banner("You enter a room with two doors on the opposite wall.")
   #######################################################
   #You enter a room with two doors on the opposite wall.#
   #######################################################
   >>>
   ```

   Assume there are no newline characters (`\n`) in the string you're given, and that the string can be printed on one line.
