## Program of the Day #11

This problem builds on POTD 10. Today's program takes two times of day, expressed in 24-hour hh:mm:ss format, and prints the elapsed time between them, expressed in total seconds. To accomplish this, you will implement two new functions:

* `to_seconds` takes a number of hours, minutes, and seconds, and converts it to a raw number of seconds. This is essentially the inverse of the `get_hours`, `get_minutes`, and `get_seconds` functions from P10.
* `timediff` takes six arguments, representing the hours, minutes, and seconds of a start and an end time. The function returns the raw number of seconds elapsed between the two times. For now, we assume that the ending time is later than the starting time.

The main program has been written for you. Note that the main program makes use of the `print_hms` function from P10, so you'll need `P10_hms.py` in the same directory as your `P11_timediff.py` file so the function from P10 can be imported.

Here's an example run of the program, with input times 10:04:04 and 12:03:00:

```
>>> %Run P11_timediff.py 10 04 04 12 03 00
01:58:56
```
