## Program of the Day #16 and 17 combined

This program will analyze a tic-tac-toe game whose board is read from a file and determine whether and how a player has won.

The main program reads the game state from the first three lines of a file that represents the game in the following format:

```
x| |x
x|o|o
o| |x
```
You can find an example game state file in P16_17_one_game.txt . Your file should read in a file which is presumed to contain only one game, but you can see more game state examples in the file P16_17_more_game_examples.txt .

Then it prints a message such as the following (for the example input above):

```
After 7 moves, nobody has won.
X| |X
X|O|O
O| |X
```

Here's another example input file, where one player has won:

```
x| |o
x|o|o
o| |x
```

The output for this game is:

```
After 7 moves, player o has won on diagonal 1.
X| |O
X|O|O
O| |X
```

To accomplish this, you will write a number of helper functions, whose behavior is detailed in the functions' specs in the skeleton code. A couple of notes:

* You can assume the input is a valid board state: moves will be either `"x"` or `"o"`, and locations with no moves will be `" "` (a single space). We won't have a board state where both players have 3 in a row).

* If a player has three in a row in multiple places, then the program can describe any one of the winning runs. For example, in the game below, player x has won on the 0th column and the 1st diagonal, so either could be reported.

  ```
  x|o|x
  x|x|o
  x|o|o
  ```

The test cases will check correctness of the helper funtions; there are currently no tests for the main program.

## Other Practice Problems

1. Implement the following function:

   ```python
   def split_address(addr_line):
       """ Split the postal address in address_line into its
       component pieces. Return a tuple of strings containing:
           (number, street, city, state, zip).
       Precondition: the address matches the following format:
           "<number> <street>, <city> <state> <zip>"
       Example: split_address("516 High St, Bellingham WA 98225")
       => ("516", "High St", "Bellingham", "WA", "98225") """
   ```

2. Download [P16_17_one_game.txt](P16_17_one_game.txt). Write a program that counts and prints the number of **unique** lines in the file. Be sure that the text file and your Python program are saved in the same directory.

3. Implement the following function:

   ```python
   def grep(string, filename):
       """ Print all lines of the file filename that contain the given string.
       Precondition: the file exists. """
   ```

5. Implement the following function:

   ```python
   def spellcheck(in_filename, out_filename wordlist):
       """ Write a spellchecked version of in_filename to
       out_filename. For each word in the input file, write
       it as-is to the output file if it is in the wordlist;
       otherwise, write it to the output file in ALLCAPS to
       indicate that it's not in the wordlist. """
   ```

Notes about the test script: You'll notice something funny looking in the test script: ``` import pickle ``` . What is a Pickle file? Pickle files are a way to write a whole python dictionary to a file. In this case, multiple game states were written to a pickle file so we can more easily test your code against different games. For the test script to work, you'll need the P16_17_test_data.pkl to be in the same directory as your code and the test script. You don't need to be able to read in this file (the test script handles that), but if you're curious, you can see the game states it's testing aginst in the file P16_17_more_game_examples.txt .
