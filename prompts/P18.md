## Program of the Day #18

In this program, you will implement a [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) translator. Morse code is a system for representing messages that could be sent over electronic communications systems - e.g., wires and radios, before computers were around. Each character in Morse code is represented using a sequence of dots and dashes, representing a short or long tone (or change in voltage on a wire). For example, the character "A" is encoded as `.-` (dot dash), and "B" is encoded as `-...` (dash dot dot dot).

The text file `P18_code.txt` contains a tranlation key: each line contains a character and its corresponding Morse code. Your task is to write a program that can translate strings to and from their Morse code representation. The main program's behavior is as follows:

The program takes the filename of the text file translation key as its first argument, and a string to translate as its second argument. Recall that you can pass a string with spaces as a single argument by enclosing it in quotes.

* If the string does not appear to be Morse code (i.e., if it does not begin with a dot or a dash), then it's treated as regular text and translated into Morse code and printed.
* If the string begins with a dot or a dash, the program assumes it's morse code and translates it back into regular text and printed.

You can see the list of valid characters for "regular text" in the translation key file. Any characters that are not in this file should be encoded as a `?`; likewise, any Morse code sequence that's not recognized should be translated into regular text as a `?`.

Since Morse codes are multiple characters, we need to have some space between them to know when one character code ends and the next begins. In real systems using Morse code, this was done by adding a pause (the length of three dots) between characters. Since we are dealing in text, we will use a space character  to separate codes. 

Here are some example runs:

```
>>> %Run P18_morse.py P18_code.txt ABC
.- -... -.-.
>>> %Run P18_morse.py P18_code.txt '.- -... -.-.'
ABC
>>> %Run P18_morse.py P18_code.txt 'O K'
---  -.-
>>> %Run P18_morse.py P18_code.txt '---  -.-'
O K
```

##### What about spaces in the input string?

We can take the following approach to allow spaces in a regular text input string to translate into and out of Morse code intact:

* After loading our translation key, add an entry that maps the space character to the empty string `''`. 
* Since our Morse code characters are printed separated by spaces, this results in 2 spaces between codes on either side of an input space. For example, `'A B'` will translate to `<A_code> <space_code> <B_code>`, but since `<space_code>` is just the empty string, we end up with `<A_code>  <B_code>` (notice there are two spaces between)
* When the above code is translated back into regular text, we split the string on single spaces. This means we end up with three codes to translate: `<A_code>`, an empty string, and `<B_code>`. Under the reverse translation mapping, the empty string is translated back into a space and we end up with the string `A B` that we started with.

To help you implement this program, we have provided four helper functions with detailed specifications in the skeleton code. 

## Other Practice Problems

1. Implement the following function. Notice that this function returns a *new* list and leaves `in_list` unmodified.

   ```python
   def copy_list(in_list):
       """ Return a new list object containing the same elements as in_list.
           Precondition: in_list's contents are all immutable. """
   
   # Example usage:
   a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   b = copy_list(a)
   b[0] = 0
   print(a[0], b[0])
   # prints 1, 0
   ```
   
2. Implement the following function. Notice that this function *does not* return a new list, but modifies the given list in place. Because the list object being modified is the same one as the caller passed in, we do not need to return another reference to the same object.

   ```python
   def cull(a):
      """ Remove a randomly chosen half of the elements from the given list """
       
   # Example usage:
   a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   cull(a)
   print(a)
   # prints [2, 3] (or any other choice of 2 elements from the original list)
   ```
