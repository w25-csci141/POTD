## Program of the Day #20

Sorting is a classic problem in computer science. In this program, you'll implement a sorting algorithm called **insertion sort**. This sort operates **in-place**, which means that it moves elements around within the input list, rather than creating a new list that's sorted.

The basic idea behind insertion sort is to notice that in the final sorted list:

* the first element will be the smallest one in the entire list.
* the second element will be the second smallest
* the third element will be the third smallest

...and so on.

With this insight in hand, we can sort using the following algorithm: for each element of the list, find the smallest thing in the *rest* of the list, then *swap* it into its correct position. For example, consider sorting the list `3 4 1 2`. In each step of the following, the current element under consideration has a `-` below it, and the smallest element (with which it will be swapped) has a `*` below it.

```
3 4 1 2   # find the smallest element among [3, 4, 1, 2]
-   *     # swap the 3 and the 1
1 4 3 2   # find the smallest element among [4, 3, 2]
  -   *   # swap the 4 and the 2
1 2 3 4   # find the smallest among [3, 4]
    *     # 3 is both the current and the smallest
    -     # "swap" 3 with itself - it doesn't move
1 2 3 4   # the smallest among [4] is trivially 4, so we're done
      -
```

 To implement this, you'll write two helper functions (`swap` and `min_index`) and the main sorting routine (`isort`). Details of these functions are provided in their specifications in the skeleton code. 

For the main program, which is not tested by the unit tests, your program should read numbers from command line arguments and print them in sorted order, as in the following sample run:

```
>>> %Run P20_sort.py 3 4 1 2
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
You can decide how many system arguments it should accept (at least 1? 0? 2 or more?).

## Other Practice Problems

0. Write an algorithm to return the index of the first occurrence of a value **v** in a list **L**.

    *Pseudocode:*

    ```
    find(v, L):
        for each element in L:
            if the element is equal to v:
                return the index of v
        return -1
    ```

1. [This is the same as one of the extra practice problems from L19]. Write an algorithm that returns the **index** of the first occurrence of of a value **v** in a **sorted** list **L**, in such a way that you **index into the list less than len(sorted_lst) times**. This means a brute-force approach of checking all elements won't work. To avoid this, you'll need to think of a way to take advantage of the fact that the list is sorted.

2. Write an algorithm that takes a list **L** and returns a *new* list containing the same elements, but arranged in sorted (increasing) order

3. Write an algorithm that takes a list **L** and sorts its contents **in place** using a different algorithm from the one above. This means that, as above, the contents of the given list are rearranged without being copied into a new list.
